In our collaborative project, I played a pivotal role in establishing the foundation by focusing on
Firebase setup and seamlessly connecting it with the front end. Additionally, I made significant
contributions to web page design. My major achievements include bolstering data security
through self-sovereign identity, crafting React web pages, and seamlessly integrating
Metamask. The major components contributed by me encompassed fetching user data,
Firebase setup, intricate page designing, security using self-sovereign identity, and creating flow
diagrams. <br/>
Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, React.js, Metamask, Firebase. <br/> <br/>

My work was mainly focused on the backend part of the platform involving smart contracts, Live
peer, and IPFS, and I also worked on the front end part in Homs, uploading Live data and show data
pages. Components made by me: Smart Contracts: Authentication, All data list Injecting
web3 and using Metamask in React. Backend Components made by me: Smart Contracts,
Authentication, Data list Injecting web3 and using Metamask in React. Authentication: Validation
of Users (Registration and Sign In). <br/>
Used Techs, Frameworks, and libraries: HTML5,CSS3,Reactjs,solidity,ipfs,metamask,smart
contracts <br/> <br/>

Storing IoT data(hashes) on IPFS(decentralized storage) by calling a smart contract and
rendering them on the Home Page. I also worked on some of the components and improved the
overall working of the application. Front end: About us page. <br/>
